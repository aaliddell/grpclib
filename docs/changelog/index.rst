Changelog
=========

0.3.0rc1
~~~~~~~~

  - Implemented ability to listen for "events" from grpclib
  - Dropped Python 3.5 support for async generators and better typing support

0.2.3rc1
~~~~~~~~

  - Implemented ``graceful_exit`` context-manager

0.2.2
~~~~~

  - Logging StreamTerminatedError on the server-side if client resets stream
  - Improved health checks support
  - Stream methods now can be called concurrently
  - Fixed flow-control window change detection for the case when the other party
    relies on connection-level window with unlimited stream-level windows
  - Fixed PING frame support on the server-side

0.2.1
~~~~~

  - Added ``Channel.__del__`` method to close unclosed connections and warn
    about them
  - Changed user-agent header to reflect ``grpclib`` and Python versions
  - Added workaround for ``h2``, when ``h2`` raises ``StreamIDTooLowError``
    instead of ``StreamClosedError``
  - Fixed race condition in the ``Channel``, which leads to creation of more
    than one connection
  - Fixed Python 3.5.1 compatibility

0.2.0
~~~~~

  - Fixed flow control functionality
  - Generate ``*_grpc.py`` stub files only if service definitions exists in the
    .proto files
  - Fixed possibility of the infinite loop when we reach max outbound streams
    limit and wait for a closed stream during
    :py:meth:`grpclib.protocol.Stream.send_request` method call
  - Added support for secure channels through SSL/TLS; pull request courtesy
    Michael P. Nitowski @mnito
  - Implemented Health service with additional functionality to help write
    health checks
  - Implemented ``ChannelFor`` helper for writing functional tests
  - Added support for UNIX sockets; pull request courtesy Andy Kipp @kippandrew
  - Implemented server reflection protocol
  - **BREAKING:** Fixed metadata encoding. Previously grpclib were using
    utf-8 to encode metadata, and now grpclib encodes metadata according to the
    gRPC wire protocol specification: ascii for regular values and base64 for
    binary values
  - **BREAKING:** Fixed "grpc-message" header encoding: unicode string -> utf-8
    -> percent-encoding (RFC 3986, ascii subset). Previously solely utf-8 were
    used, which now will fail to decode, if you send non-ascii characters
  - Implemented sending custom metadata from the server-side

0.1.1
~~~~~

  - Dropped protobuf requirement, now it's optional
  - New feature to specify custom message serialization/deserialization codec
  - Fixed critical issue on the client-side with hanging coroutines in case of
    connection lost or stream reset
  - Replaced ``async-timeout`` dependency with custom utilities, refactored
    deadlines implementation
  - Improved connection lost handling; pull request courtesy Michael
    Elsd√∂rfer @miracle2k
  - Improved error responses and errors handling
  - Deprecated ``end`` keyword-only argument in the
    :py:meth:`grpclib.server.Stream.send_message` method on the server-side

0.1.0
~~~~~

  - Improved example to show all RPC method types; pull request courtesy @claws
  - [rc2] Fixed issues with sending large messages
  - [rc1] Initial release
